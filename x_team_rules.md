# X-Team 12 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* Use a spreadsheet on google docs.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
* Use tools on the spreadsheet to keep people up to date on tasks that have been completed (i.e. fill cells).


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
* Message it in group chat.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
