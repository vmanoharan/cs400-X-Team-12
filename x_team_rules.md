# X-Team 12 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* Use a spreadsheet on google docs, with a row for each team member. Add tasks in each team member's row, and
delegate using group chat.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
* Use tools on the spreadsheet to keep people up to date on tasks that have been completed. Fill cells red that
haven't been completed yet, and fill them green when they have been completed.


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
* We have a group chat up and running, and will use it solely for arranging meeting times and communicating with
one another about issues with tasks.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
* We will communicate frequently, keeping one another updated on progress through the group chat and the
spreadsheet, and arrange additional meetings when needed.
